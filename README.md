# Virtual Mouse 

## A python application to replicate mouse events with just a camera and props

Controlling mouse events with just your hands.

Props used here are just the red, green and yellow color object which you can place on your hands.

OpenCV is used for image processing, contour detection for detecting correct color

## Various Mouse Events
    + Mouse Movement
    + Dragging an Item
    + Scrolling
    + double click

## Various Props actions contribute mouse events such as -
    + Mouse is controlled using green color
    + taking yellow color close to green activates mouse hold which can be used to drag an item
    + Scrolling can be done by increasing the distance between red and yellow color
    + Double click is done by taking red color close to yellow color



## A hsv_adjuster file is also added which can be used to make our own hsv color values by adjusting the color sliders for upper and lower color bond
